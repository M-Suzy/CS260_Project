After trying several filters before and after extraction of binary layers, the most optimal Filter was Gaussian with radius 1.9.
The filter worked well on removal of unnessary dust in the image making the layers much smoothened.The radius 1.9 worked well on all 
of the image, as smaller radius in some cases left dusts on the extracted image, while higher radius caused loose of 
information in the layer3 and layer2.

For head rotations and emotions, the layer 2 was mostly very accurate. 
Layer 0 was interesting on head rotations as mainly the intensity of white pixels was getting larger due to hair parts.
Some deductions can be made calculating orientation angle with moments, as while head rotation happens the angle significantly varies 
from frontal images.
